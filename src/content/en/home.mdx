# Hey, I'm Gabriel Molter

In a hurry? Go straight to my [Portfolio](/en/portfolio).

I am a {myAge()}-year-old full stack developer from [Petrópolis, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Petr%C3%B3polis,+RJ/), currently living in [Vancouver, Canada](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Vancouver,+BC).

I started working with web development in 2011, when I was 14 years old, designing and implementing Flash websites.

Also in 2011, I started developing iOS apps. The first app I released on the AppStore made it to the Top 10 Educational Apps in Brazil.

In 2015 I switched my attention back to web development and started studying towards my [Microsoft HTML5, CSS3 and JS certification](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/73c5d0e8-9412-427f-86dc-a155cc276c20/public_url), which I got in 2016.

As of today, I am an IT student, and a freelancer for companies both in Canada and Brazil.
